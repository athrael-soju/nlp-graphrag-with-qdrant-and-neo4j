Robotech: The Last Defender
The skies above Earth burned with streaks of light as the Invid invasion force descended like a swarm of locusts. Commander Alex Carter tightened his grip on the controls of his Veritech fighter, his heart pounding in sync with the warning alarms blaring in his cockpit. This was it—the final stand for humanity’s future.

“Bravo Squadron, form up on me!” Alex commanded through the comms. His team, a ragtag band of survivors, acknowledged with determined voices. They were all that was left of the REF’s elite force, battered but unbroken.

The battle over Reflex Point had taken its toll. Most of their fleet was gone, their mecha reduced to burning wreckage. But Alex refused to back down. If Earth had any hope, it lay in their hands.

As the first wave of Invid Shock Troopers swooped in, Alex flipped his Veritech into Battloid mode and fired a volley of missiles. Explosions rippled through the enemy ranks, but for every one they destroyed, more took its place.

“We can’t win this!” his wingman, Lieutenant Rena Sterling, shouted.

“We’re not here to win,” Alex replied grimly. “We’re here to buy time.”

A new energy signature flashed on his radar—a massive Invid carrier emerging from the clouds. At its core, the Regess herself. If they could take her out, they might just have a chance.

“Form up! We make one final push!”

His squadron dove toward the mothership, weaving through enemy fire. Rena’s Alpha Fighter was hit, spiraling out of control. Alex watched in horror as she ejected, her escape pod vanishing into the chaos.

With a roar, Alex fired his last missiles straight into the heart of the Invid carrier. A brilliant explosion engulfed the sky, and for a moment, everything was silent. Then, the Invid forces hesitated—their queen was gone.

As the enemy scattered, Alex exhaled. The battle was over. Earth had survived.

But at what cost?

Looking down at the smoking ruins below, Alex made a silent vow: We will rebuild. We will rise again.

And so, as the first light of dawn broke over the battlefield, humanity’s last defenders stood tall—ready to reclaim their world.
